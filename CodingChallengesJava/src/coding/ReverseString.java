/**
 * Reverse an array without affecting special characters

Given a string, that contains special character together with alphabets (‘a’ to ‘z’ and ‘A’ to ‘Z’), reverse the string in a way that special characters are not affected.

Examples:

Input:   str = "a,b$c"
Output:  str = "c,b$a"
Note that $ and , are not moved anywhere.  
Only subsequence "abc" is reversed

Input:   str = "Ab,c,de!$"
Output: str = "ed,c,bA!$"
